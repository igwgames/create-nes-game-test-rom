# create-nes-game-test-rom

Test rom to make sure things like CI work with create-nes-game. Not actively used, but feel free to look at it as an example!

Otherwise, please take a look at [create-nes-game](https://cppchriscpp.github.io/create-nes-game/), the main repository.

# How to compile

This rom uses [create-nes-game](https://cppchriscpp.github.io/create-nes-game/) to build. Download a copy
of that to start.

## First time setup

1. Download [create-nes-game](https://cppchriscpp.github.io/create-nes-game/), if you haven't already.
2. (Optional) Run `./create-nes-game install` to install the tool globally
3. Run `create-nes-game download-dependencies` to download dependencies of this game into this folder
4. Proceed to the next section to build the rom.

## Building the game

To build the rom, run `create-nes-game build` in the same directory as this readme file. 

You can run the game using the selected emulator (if available on your operating system) using the 
`create-nes-game run` command. Alternatively, the rom is available in the `rom/` folder.

## Running unit tests

This rom includes unit tests that can be used to verify that the game works. Run them using the 
`create-nes-game test` command. 

The tests are located in the `test/` folder.

# NESLib 

This rom uses multiple tools from [Shiru](https://shiru.untergrund.net/) - namely neslib and famitone2. You can find the 
details on [Shiru's website](https://shiru.untergrund.net/). The readme files are probably the best reference.

It was also bundled with music and sound effects from Shiru's game 
[LAN Master](https://shiru.untergrund.net) - which have likely been replaced with the game's own assets.


## Sound Effects

Sound effects should be created using [famitracker](http://famitracker.com) (Version 0.4.6). They should be exported
as an NSF file, and stored in `sound/sfx.nsf`. The tool will automatically convert them using famitone2's tools. 

How to do this, from famitracker:
1. In the `File` menu, select `Create NSF`.
2. Toward the middle of the dialog, there is a `Type of file` dropdown - choose `NSF - Nintendo Sound File`
3. Save the generated file into the `sound/` folder as `sfx.nsf`.

Next time you run `create-nes-game build` your new sound effects will be added to the game.

## Music

Music is created using [Famitracker 0.4.6](http://famitracker.com/). Once you have music you like, you'll need to
export it for use with this engine. Follow these steps to do so: 

1. In the `File` menu, select `Export Text`
2. Save the generated file into the `sound/` folder as `music.txt`

Next time you run `create-nes-game build` your new music will be added to the game.
